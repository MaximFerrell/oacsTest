USB 3.0 is a Common Serial Bus (USB) common, released in November 2008. Most new pcs and devices being created today support USB 3.0. USB 3.0 can often be known as SuperSpeed USB.

Devices that abide by the USB 3.0 regular can theoretically transmit data at a maximum rate of 5 Gbps, or 5,120 Mbps. That is in stark comparison to previous USB benchmarks, like USB 2.0, that in best can only just transmit data at 480 Mbps or USB 1.1 that tops out in 12 Mbps.

USB 3.2 is an updated version of USB 3.1 (SuperSpeed+) and is the latest USB normal. It does increase this theoretical maximum acceleration to 20 Gbps (20,480 Mbps), while USB 3.1 will come in at a maximum acceleration of 10 Gbps (10,240 Mbps).

Note: Older USB devices, cables, and adapters could be physically appropriate for USB 3.0 hardware but if you need the most effective possible data transmission fee, all products must support USB 3.0.

# USB 3.0 Connectors

The male connector about a USB 3.0 cable or flash drive is named the plug. The female connector on the USB 3.0 computer port, extension cable, or machine is called the receptacle.

 - USB Type A: These connectors, officially known as USB 3.0 Standard-A, are the simple rectangular kind of USB connectors, just like the plug towards the end of a  flash get. USB 3.0 Type A plugs and receptacles are physically appropriate for those from USB 2.0 and USB 1.1.

 - USB Type B: These connectors, officially known as USB 3.0 Standard-B and USB 3.0 Powered-B, are square with a sizeable notch at the top and are usually entirely on printers and other large products. USB 3.0 Type B plugs are not compatible with Type B receptacles from older USB specifications but plugs from those older specifications are compatible with USB 3.0 Type B receptacles.

 - USB Micro-A: USB 3.0 Micro-A connectors are rectangular, "two-part" plugs and so are found on many smartphones and similar lightweight gadgets. USB 3.0 Micro-A plugs are only appropriate for USB 3.0 Micro-AB receptacles but older USB 2.0 Micro-A plugs will continue to work in USB 3.0 Micro-AB receptacles.

 - USB Micro-B: USB 3.0 Micro-B connectors look nearly the same as their Micro-A counterparts and are found on equivalent gadgets. USB 3.0 Micro-B plugs are appropriate for USB 3.0 Micro-B receptacles and USB 3.0 Micro-AB receptacles only. Old USB 2.0 Micro B plugs are also physically appropriate for both USB 3.0 Micro-B and USB 3.0 Micro-AB receptacles.

*__Note__: The USB 2.0 specification comes with USB Mini-A and USB Mini-B plugs, and USB Mini-B and USB Mini-AB receptacles, but USB 3.0 does not support these connectors. If you encounter these connectors, they need to come to be USB 2.0 connectors.*
