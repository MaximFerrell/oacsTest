Several seven companies commenced the production of USB in 1994: Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Nortel. The target was to create it fundamentally much easier to connect external products to PCs by changing the multitude of connectors at the back of PCs, addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces, and simplifying software construction of all devices linked to USB, and permitting greater data prices for external units. A team including Ajay Bhatt done the typical at Intel the primary integrated circuits helping USB were produced by Intel in 1995.

The initial USB 1.0 specification, that was introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer costs of 1 1.5 Mbit/s Low Rate and 12 Mbit/s Full Speed. Microsoft House windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the units. The first widely used variation of USB was 1.1, that was released found in September 1998. The 12 Mbit/s data price was designed for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5 Mbit/s rate for low data rate products such as for example joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the primary mainstream item with USB and the iMac's accomplishment popularized USB itself. Pursuing Apple's style decision to remove all legacy ports from the iMac, many Computer manufacturers started out building legacy-free of charge PCs, which resulted in the broader PC marketplace applying USB as a standard.

The USB 2.0 specification was released in April 2000 and was ratified by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) by the end of 2001. Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Lucent Systems (today Nokia), NEC, and Philips jointly led the initiative to build up an increased data transfer level, with the resulting specification achieving 480 Mbit/s, 40 times as quickly as the original USB 1.1 specification.

The USB 3.0 specification was published on 12 November 2008. Its key goals were to improve the data transfer fee (up to 5 Gbit/s), decrease power usage, increase power productivity, and be backward appropriate for USB 2.0.USB 3.0 carries a new, higher quickness bus called SuperSpeed in parallel with the USB 2.0 bus. That is why, the new version can be called SuperSpeed. The 1st USB 3.0 equipped devices were presented in January 2010.

By 2008, approximately 6 billion USB ports and interfaces were found in the global market place, and about 2 billion were for sale each year.

The USB 3.1 specification was posted in July 2013.

In December 2014, USB-IF submitted USB 3.1, USB Power Delivery 2.0 and USB Type-C features to the IEC (TC 100 - Audio, video and multimedia devices and apparatus) for inclusion in the international regular IEC 62680 General Serial Bus interfaces for info and power, which happens to be predicated on USB 2.0.

The USB 3.2 specification was published in September 2017.

# USB 1.x

Released in January 1996, USB 1.0 specified info rates of just one 1.5 Mbit/s (Low Bandwidth or Low Speed) and 12 Mbit/s (Full Speed). It didn't allow for extension cables or pass-through monitors, because of timing and power constraints. Few USB devices managed to get to the marketplace until USB 1.1 was released found in August 1998. USB 1.1 was the initial revision that was widely adopted and led to what Microsoft designated the "Legacy-free PC".

Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 specified a design for any connector smaller than the common type A or perhaps type B. Though many styles for a miniaturised type B connector came out on various peripherals, conformance to the USB 1.x common was hampered by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors as if they had a good tethered connection (that is: no plug or perhaps receptacle at the peripheral end). There is no noted miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (revision 1.01) introduced one.

# USB 2.0

USB 2.0 premiered in April 2000, adding an increased maximum signaling fee of 480 Mbit/s (High Speed or Superior Bandwidth), as well as the USB 1.x Whole Speed signaling charge of 12 Mbit/s. Because of bus access constraints, the effective throughput of the High Speed signaling amount is bound to 280 Mbit/s or 35 MB/s.

Modifications to the USB specification have already been made via Engineering Switch Notices (ECN). The most important of the ECNs are included in to the USB 2.0 specification bundle available from USB.org:
 - Mini-A and Mini-B Connector
 - Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification 1.01
 - InterChip USB Supplement
 - On-The-Go Health supplement 1.3 USB On-The-Go allows for two USB gadgets to communicate with the other person without requiring another USB host
 - Battery Charging Specification 1.1 Added support for committed chargers, web host chargers behaviour for products with dead batteries
 - Battery Charging Specification 1.2 with increased current of just one 1.5 A on charging ports for unconfirmed gadgets, allowing Great Speed communication whilst having a current up to 1 1.5 A and allowing a optimum current of 5 A
 - Link Power Operations Addendum ECN which adds a sleep power state
USB 3.x

The USB 3.0 specification was released on 12 November 2008, with its supervision transferring from USB 3.0 Promoter Group to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), and announced on 17 November 2008 at the SuperSpeed USB Developers Meeting.

USB 3.0 adds a good SuperSpeed transfer setting, with associated backward compatible plugs, receptacles, and cables. SuperSpeed plugs and receptacles happen to be identified with a definite logo and blue inserts in normal format receptacles.

The SuperSpeed bus provides for a transfer mode at a nominal rate of 5.0 Gbit/s, in addition to the three existing transfer modes. Its efficiency would depend on several factors incorporating physical symbol encoding and website link level overhead. At a 5 Gbit/s (625 Mbyte/s) signaling amount with 8b/10b encoding, the raw throughput is usually 500 Mbyte/s. When flow control, packet framing and protocol overhead are considered, it really is realistic for 400 Mbyte/s (3.2 Gbit/s) or more to be delivered to an application. Communication is full-duplex in SuperSpeed transfer mode; earlier modes are half-duplex, arbitrated by the host.

Low-power and high-power products remain operational with this common, but devices using SuperSpeed can take benefit of increased available recent of between 150 mA and 900 mA, respectively.

USB 3.1, released found in July 2013, preserves the prevailing SuperSpeed transfer rate under a new label USB 3.1 Gen 1, and introduces a fresh SuperSpeed+ transfer mode, USB 3.1 Gen 2 with the utmost data signaling amount to 10 Gbit/s (1250 MB/s, twice the level of USB 3.0), which reduces series encoding overhead to just 3% by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b.

USB 3.2, released in September 2017, preserves existing USB 3.1 SuperSpeed and SuperSpeed+ data modes but introduces two fresh SuperSpeed+ transfer modes over the USB-C connector with data prices of 10 and 20 Gbit/s (1250 and 2500 MB/s). The increase in bandwidth is because multi-lane procedure over existing wires which were intended for flip-flop capacities of the Type-C connector.
