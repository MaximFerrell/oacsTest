USB 1.1 is a Common Serial Bus (USB) common, released in August 1998. The USB 1.1 typical has been all but replaced by USB 2.0, and soon by USB 3.0.

USB 1.1 may also be called Full Velocity USB.

There are two different "speeds" at which a USB 1.1 device can run at - either Low-Bandwidth at 1.5 Mbps or Full Bandwidth at 12 Mbps. That is considerably slower than USB 2.0's 480 Mbps and USB 3.0's 5,120 Mbps maximum transfer rates.

Important: USB 1.0 was released in January 1996 but issues for the reason that let go prevented widespread support for USB. These concerns had been corrected in USB 1.1 and are the standard that most pre-USB-2.0 units support.

USB 1.1 Connectors

Note: Plug is the name given to a USB 1.1 male connector and receptacle is usually what the feminine connector is called.

 - USB Type A: These plugs and receptacles are officially referred to as Series A good connectors and so are the commonly seen, perfectly rectangular USB connectors. USB 1.1 Type A connectors are physically compatible with the two USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 Type B connectors.

 - USB Type B: These plugs and receptacles are officially referred to as Series B connectors and so are square except for a good rounding at the very top. USB 1.1 Type B plugs are physically appropriate for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 Type B receptacles but USB 3.0 Type B plugs aren't backward appropriate for USB 1.1 Type B receptacles.

Important: Depending on alternatives made by the maker, a specific USB 3.0 device may or might not exactly work properly on a computer or different host that was designed for USB 1.1, despite the fact that the plugs and receptacles physically connect to each other. Basically, USB 3.0 units are allowed to be backward appropriate for USB 1.1 but aren't required to be so.

Note: Aside from the incompatible problems mentioned previously, USB 1.1 products and cables are, generally, physically compatible with USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 hardware, both Type A and Type B. However, whatever newer common some the main USB-connected system supports, you may never reach a data rate faster than 12 Mbps if you're using possibly one USB 1.1 part.
