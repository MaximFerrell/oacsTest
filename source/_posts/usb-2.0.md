USB 2.0 is a Universal Serial Bus (USB) normal. Almost all units with USB capabilities, and practically all USB cables, support at least USB 2.0.

Devices that abide by the USB 2.0 standard be capable of transmit data at a optimum speed of 480 Mbps. This is faster than the more aged USB 1.1 common and much slower compared to the newer USB 3.0 typical.
USB 1.1 premiered found in August 1998, USB 2.0 found in April 2000, and USB 3.0 in November 2008.

# USB 2.0 Connectors

*__Note__: Plug is the name given to the male connector on a USB 2.0 wire or flash drive, while the receptacle may be the name granted to the female connector on a USB 2.0 device or extension cable.*

 - USB Type A good: These connectors are technically called USB 2.0 Standard-A and so are the flawlessly rectangular USB connectors you'll find of all non-mobile devices. USB 2.0 Type A connectors are physically appropriate for those from USB 3.0 and USB 1.1.

 - USB Type B: These connectors are actually technically called USB 2.0 Standard-B and are square except for a little notch at the top. USB 2.0 Type B plugs are physically compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 1.1 Type B receptacles but USB 3.0 Type B plugs aren't backward compatible with USB 2.0 Type B receptacles.

 - USB Micro-A: These connectors, especially the plugs, look like miniature variants of USB 2.0 Type A connectors. USB 2.0 Micro-A plugs are appropriate for both USB 2.0 Micro-AB receptacles and USB 3.0 Micro-AB receptacles. Even so, newer USB 3.0 Micro-A plugs will not fit in USB 2.0 Micro-AB receptacles.

 - USB Micro-B: These connectors are actually small and rectangular but two corners using one side are actually slanted instead of square. USB 2.0 Micro-B plugs are appropriate for four receptacles: both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 Micro-B and Micro-AB receptacles. Newer USB 3.0 Micro-B plugs are not backward compatible with either USB 2.0 Micro receptacle.

 - USB Mini-A: These connectors are little and mostly rectangular with one very rounded aspect. USB 2.0 Mini-A plugs are just appropriate for USB 2.0 Mini-AB receptacles.

 - USB Mini-B: These connectors are actually tiny and mostly rectangular with noticeable indentions on the short sides. USB 2.0 Mini-B plugs are appropriate for USB 2.0 Mini-B and USB 2.0 Mini-AB receptacles.

*__Note__: Only USB 2.0 supports USB Mini-A, USB Mini-B, and USB Mini-AB connectors.*

# Interconnected Device Speeds

Older USB 1.1 units and cables are, generally, physically appropriate for USB 2.0 hardware. On the other hand, the only way to attain USB 2.0 transmitting speeds is if all devices and cables being linked to each other support USB 2.0.

If, for example, you have a good USB 2.0 device used in combination with a USB 1.0 cable, the 1.0 speed will be utilized regardless of the fact that these devices helps USB 2.0 since that cable will not support the newer, faster speeds.

USB 2.0 units and cables used in combination with USB 3.0 units and cables, assuming they're physically compatible, will operate at the lower USB 2.0 speed.

Basically, the transmission speed falls to the older of the two technologies. This is practical since you can't pull USB 3.0 speeds out of a USB 2.0 cable, nor can you get USB 2.0 transmitting speeds using a USB 1.1 cable. 

# USB On-the-Go (OTG)

USB On-the-Go premiered found in December 2006, after USB 2.0 but before USB 3.0. USB OTG allows products to switch between performing as a bunch and as a slave when important so that they can become connected to one another directly.

For example, a USB 2.0 smartphone or tablet might be able to pull data from a flash drive as a host but then switch over to slave mode when linked to a computer in order that information can be taken from it. 

These devices that supplies power (the host) is considered the OTG A-device while the the one which consumes power (the slave) is called the B-device. The slave works as the peripheral machine in this type of setup.

Switching roles is conducted utilizing the Host Negotiation Protocol (HNP), but physically choosing which will USB 2.0 device is highly recommended the slave or host by default is really as easy as choosing which end of the cable the device is connected to.

Once in a while, HNP polling will need place simply by the host to determine if the slave is requesting to be the host, in which particular case they can swap places. USB 3.0 uses HNP polling as well but it's called Purpose Swap Protocol (RSP).
