USB charging is becoming so common that it is now simple to find replacement electric outlets in the home improvement retailers with USB ports constructed it, negating the necessity for a USB electric power adapter.

# USB Versions

There were three major USB standards, 3.1 being the most recent:
- USB 3.1: Called Superspeed+, USB 3.1 compliant equipment can easily transfer info at 10 Gbps (10,240 Mbps).
- USB 3.0: Named SuperSpeed USB, USB 3.0 compliant hardware can reach a optimum transmission fee of 5 Gbps (5,120 Mbps).
- USB 2.0: Named High-Speed USB, USB 2.0 compliant units can reach a maximal transmission rate of 480 Mbps.
- USB 1.1: Called Total Speed USB, USB 1.1 devices can reach a maximum transmitting fee of 12 Mbps.

Most USB equipment and cables today adhere to USB 2.0, and an increasing number to USB 3.0.

*__Important__: The elements of a USB-connected program, like the host (such as a pc), the cable, and these devices, can all support different USB standards as long as they happen to be physically compatible. On the other hand, all parts must support the same standard if you would like it to achieve the maximum data rate practical.*

USB was made to standardize the connection of peripherals want keyboards, pointing units, digital still and video cameras, printers, portable mass media players, disk drives and network adapters to computers, both to communicate and also to supply energy. It has largely replaced interfaces such as for example serial ports and parallel ports, and is becoming commonplace on a variety of devices.

USB connectors have already been increasingly replacing other styles for electric battery chargers of portable devices.
