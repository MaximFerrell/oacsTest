The General Serial Bus was developed to simplify and increase the interface between computers and peripheral equipment, in comparison to previously existing standard or ad-hoc proprietary interfaces.

From the computer user's perspective, the USB interface improved simplicity in several ways. The USB interface is self-configuring, therefore the user need certainly not adjust settings on these devices and interface for quickness or data format, or configure interrupts, input/end result addresses, or direct recollection access channels. USB connectors are standardized at the web host, so any peripheral can use any obtainable receptacle. USB takes total advantage of the excess processing power which can be economically put into peripheral devices in order that they are able to manage themselves; USB products often don't have user-adjustable interface adjustments. The USB user interface is "sizzling hot pluggable", meaning devices could be exchanged without rebooting the web host computer. Small devices can be powered straight from the USB user interface, displacing extra power supply cables. Because usage of the USB logos is merely permitted after compliance evaluating, the user can have confidence a USB device will continue to work as expected without comprehensive interaction with settings and configuration; the USB user interface defines protocols for recovery from common errors, improving reliability over previous interfaces.Installation of a device counting on the USB normal requires minimal operator actions. When a device is connected to a interface on a running personal computer system, it really is either entirely quickly configured using existing unit drivers, or the machine prompts the individual to discover a driver which can be after that installed and configured quickly.

For hardware manufacturers and application developers, the USB normal eliminates the requirement to develop proprietary interfaces to innovative peripherals. The broad range of transfer speeds obtainable from a USB user interface suits devices ranging from keyboards and mice up to streaming video interfaces. A USB user interface could be designed to provide the best obtainable latency for time-critical capabilities, or can be set up to do background transfers of mass data with little effect on system resources. The USB user interface is generalized without signal lines focused on only one function of 1 device.

# USB Limits

USB cables are limited in length, as the standard was meant to hook up to peripherals on a single table-top, not between bedrooms or between buildings. On the other hand, a USB port can be linked to a gateway that accesses distant units. USB includes a strict "tree" topology and "master-slave" protocol for addressing peripheral equipment; peripheral devices cannot connect to each other except via the sponsor, and two hosts cannot communicate over their USB ports straight. Some extension to this limitation can be done through USB On-The-Go. A bunch cannot "broadcast" signals to all peripherals simultaneously, each should be addressed separately. Some high speed peripheral units require sustained speeds unavailable in the USB normal.While converters exist between certain "legacy" interfaces and USB, they may well not provide full implementation of the legacy hardware; for instance, a USB to parallel interface converter may work very well with a printer, however, not with a scanner that will require bi-directional make use of of the data pins.

For something developer, make use of USB requires implementation of a complex protocol and implies an "intelligent" controller in the peripheral device. Developers of USB products designed for market generally must get yourself a USB ID which takes a fee paid out to the Implementers' Forum. Developers of goods that utilize the USB specification must sign an agreement with Implementer's Forum. Usage of the USB logos on the merchandise require annual service fees and membership in the business.
