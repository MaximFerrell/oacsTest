### Seize Opportunities to Become the Next Leading PCB Manufacturer

Since the spread of the methods used in modern printed circuit boards, the development of the industry has gone far beyond its original functions. Today's PCBs are tiny, multi-layered, and have complex systems. With advanced design software and manufacturing processes, PCBs are far more productive and efficient than ever before. However, with the growth of technology and consumer demand, PCB, as the foundation of all electronic devices, also carries a lot of expectations. So, what’s next for PCBs?

#### 3D Printed Electronics

3D printing technology is one of the most exciting technological innovations in recent years. From 3D-printed organs to guns and ammunition, 3D printing has reached many incredible achievements in various industries. The PCB industry is no exception.

Compared with the traditional 2D PCB, 3D-printed electronics, or 3D PE, has tremendous technological and manufacturing advantages. 3D PE can be formed into a PCB suitable for any circuit carrier while still combining electronic, optical and mechanical functions. Additionally, the automated production process can eliminate human errors as much as possible, thus improving the overall accuracy and efficiency.

Due to these advantages, 3D PE production has witnessed a rapid development in a high demand situation, although 3D PE applications are currently relatively limited, mainly for instrumentation, antennas, and sensors. With the discovery of new methods and applications of 3D PE technology in industries and consumer demands, many industry leaders expect the 3D PE industry to expand rapidly.

#### Flex-rigid PCBs

Flex-rigid PCBs have many advantages over just using rigid or flexible PCBs for certain applications. At present, many industries are promoting the development of flex-rigid PCBs, such as LED lighting, wearable technology, display, and medical instrumentation. If this trend continues, people in the PCB industry are expected to see more flex-rigid PCB designs and applications in the future.

#### Biodegradable PCBs

E-waste is one of the biggest environmental problems of modern society. PCBs are an important part of this issue. Some PCB materials cannot be degraded and often end up in landfills, polluting the surrounding soil. If the wasted PCBs are not properly treated, the chemicals in remains will do harm to the environment. Therefore, the demand for environmentally friendly PCBs increases.

Some scientists suggest that we tackle the pollution problem by changing the manufacturing process of PCBs, which means replacing traditional substrates with more environmentally friendly alternatives. These biodegradable substrates do not require harmful etching chemicals to finish the assembly process. These consequences will help to reduce the environmental impact of the entire electronics and manufacturing costs.

#### PCB Cameras

PCB cameras are directly mounted on circuit boards. These PCB cameras consist of lenses, apertures and image sensors and are designed to take digital photos and videos. In short, the camera is rather tiny and can be mounted on PCBs of any size. In other words, these PCB cameras are small enough to plug into any electronic device. Due to its small size, PCB cameras have many applications in all walks of life, including electronic products, medical devices, monitoring technology and so on.

Such industries are only a few examples of how PCBs cameras can be used and how trends may continue to the future. As time goes on, with increasingly wide application, PCB cameras are moving toward more customizable and durable.

According to the global PCB ranking data of NTI in 2016, it is expected that by 2021, the proportion of PCB with high technology content, such as high multi-layer board, flexible board, HDI board and encapsulated substrate will reach 60.58%. With the increasing demand for high-tech PCB, it is particularly important to find out the future direction and improve the technical level. One of the best ways to better keep up with the trend is to attend well-known and professional industrial exhibitions are also an important channel to understand the future trend of the PCB industry. Not long ago, The World’s leading trade fair and conference for electronics —— Electronica is held in Munich. Among all the exhibitors, Shenzhen Mincom, a one-stop [PCB manufacturing](https://www.k-pcba.com/) and assembly service, was well recognized by visitors from all over the world. This year’s slogan of electronica is “Connecting everything—smart, safe & secure”. What other technological marvels will blow the lid off the PCB market in the future? Choosing the reliable PCB manufacturers will help to occupy a dominant position in the market.
